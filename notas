about when to use bike or car:
interpreting the docs i came to the conclusion that
the relation between bike's effort and car's emissions per effort
is the determining factor for choosing a transport medium

since the relation between car's effort and emmissions per kilometer
is the same the car's emissions per effort always resolves to 15,
that leaves the bikes effort as the only invariant in the relation
so, when the bike's effort is bigger than 15 (ie 1.5km) it equals the cars
emissions per effort, a bigger distance will result in choosing the car,
and a lesser one in chooseing the bike
